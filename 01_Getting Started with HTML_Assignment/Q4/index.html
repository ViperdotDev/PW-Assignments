<!-- Q:Write a short note on Tag and element with an example? -->
<!-- Ans:  In HTML, a tag is a markup code used to define an element on a web page. Tags are enclosed within angle brackets (< and >) and are used to structure and format the content of a web page. Tags can be thought of as the building blocks of an HTML document, and they define how different parts of the content are displayed or behave.
An element, on the other hand, consists of an opening tag, content, and a closing tag. The opening tag contains the name of the element, and the closing tag is similar but with a forward slash (/) before the element name. Elements can also be self-closing if they don't contain any content between the opening and closing tags.-->
